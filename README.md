<h2 align="center">ℹ️ About Me</h2>  

🚑🎓💻 Hello! I'm a Software Engineering MSc graduate with a distinction from the University of Westminster. After a fulfilling 20-year career as a paramedic, including over three years as a Flight Paramedic with London's Air Ambulance 🚁, I've transitioned into software engineering, a field I've always been passionate about.

💾🎮🛠️ During my studies, I developed a strong interest in the "lower-level" aspects of software development, particularly through my thesis project to design an educational 8-bit microcontroller simulator. This solidified my passion for computer science and programming. Recently, I completed a 12-week Unity game engine bootcamp, which has further fueled my interest in game development and programming. I'm currently working on building my own game engine in C++, using the Windows Console for displaying graphics to gain a deeper understanding of game engine design and games programming.

🤝🌱🧠 My background in healthcare instilled in me essential skills such as teamwork, quick decision-making, and the desire to continue to learn. I want to bring these qualities to my software engineering and game development career. I'm eager to take on roles that push my knowledge and allow me to grow and ultimately be in a position to help others to develop their skills. 

🚀 Thank you for visiting my profile! Feel free to explore my projects, and reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate.
